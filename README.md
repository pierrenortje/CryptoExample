The code in this project shows you how to share a symmetric key between a server (.NET) and a client (JS) using asymmetric encryption.

Using the symmetric key it encrypts a message from the server and sends it back to the client to decrypt it (and vice versa).

I have written an article on Medium.com that takes you through the code here:

Hopefully you've learned something new today!
